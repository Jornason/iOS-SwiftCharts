# Using ShinobiCharts with Swift on iOS8

### Introduction

Probably the most unexpected announcement from a WWDC of recent years was the
introduction of a new programming language on Monday at WWDC2014. At first
glance Swift appears to be a well-thought-out, modern language, and I think that
as developers we're going to have a lot of fun getting to know Swift and using
it over the coming years.

Obviously my first question was "how can I use ShinobiControls from Swift?", and
I'm sure it was yours too. We'll be reviewing how we adopt the new features made
available to us in Xcode 6 over the coming weeks and months, but I want to know
how to make it work now.

In this post I'll review the steps you need to go through to integrate an 
old-style framework on iOS with Swift (not to be confused by the new dynamic
frameworks introduced in iOS8). This is how all the different ShinobiControls
products are distributed, and so this represents the approach to getting them
to work in Xcode 6 beta.

It's worth noting that this process is not necessarily going to be considered
best practice in future. As I mentioned, we're reviewing the new features made
available in Xcode 6, and this includes the dynamic frameworks.

The code for this project is available on Github at ..., but it's pretty simple -
it's probably just as simple to follow along.
